Post Install Settings Guide:

Make sure VSYNC is off in your graphics card driver options.

^^^^^^ This is very important. Tribes handles very poorly with VSYNC enabled.


Make sure Enhance Pointer Precision is off under Pointer Options in the Mouse Control Panel Settings.
Mouse acceleration is up to you, but most players disable mouse acceleration.

If your mouse is un-useable (jumps all over the place): 

You may have windows text scaling set higher than 100%. to fix this issue for Tribes only (without having to go make all fonts small again), right-click Tribes.exe and then click Properties. On the Compatibility tab, select Disable Display Scaling On High DPI Settings, and then click OK. You can also try checking off 'Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows XP Service Pack 2'. If both those fail, try setting fonts back to 100% in your display settings (?).

(the installer should automatically do this for you!)

Demos:          

A few tutorial demos for each of the LT positions have been included in the configuration. The tutorials cover each of the positions outlined in the LT guide: capper, light offense, chaser, home defense. If you read the LT guide and then watch these recordings you should have a basic understanding of LT and how each position should be played.
