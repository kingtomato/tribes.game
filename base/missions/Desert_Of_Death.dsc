The battle is taking place amongst the ancient ruins of this extinct people.  Neither tribe has a permanent base, instead each have set up their camps in small pyramidal buildings.  Each pyramid houses the tribal flags.  Grab the enemy tribe's flag and bring it back to the pyramid, touching it to your own flag to capture it.  Victory will be achieved by the team that successfully captures their opponent's flag four times.";
