Each team must grab the other's flag and successfully bring it back to their base to capture it for a point.  There is also a center watch tower that will prove to be crucial in the battle; the team that holds this fortification gains a valuable tactical advantage over the other as well as one point.  The first team to reach 6 points shall be the victor!";
