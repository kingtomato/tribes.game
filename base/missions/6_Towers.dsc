Once captured, all objects associated with that switch--turrets, generators, stations, etc.--come under your team's command.  For every minute your team holds a switch and prevents an enemy team from touching it, you get points.  The longer you hold it, the more points you get.\n\nIn this training mission, there are three switches you must capture, currently held by enemy AI players.  Get past the enemy players and their defenses and touch all three switches to complete your objective.";
