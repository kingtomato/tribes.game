Each side has a Power Plant and Flag Base.  Inside the Power Plant, there are two generators and solar panels.  Destroy the solar panels to take down the force fields protecting the Generator Room.  Destroy the smaller generator to bring down the force fields protecting the enemy's flag base.  The larger generator powers the devices and turrets inside the Power Plant.  Note that the solar panels on the flag base do not power the force fields, only the stations.  Got it?  Coordination is key, a blind rush for the flag is doomed to failure.  Five captures are required for victory.";
