Open Call2 version 3.0

This is the updated version of the Open Call 2 map pack.  There may be other versions, depending on the reception of the maps included within.  You will need DOX's map pack for the maps to work correctly.  

Much Thanks go out to the people involved in the long process of making this pack.  The_Pope, xpdnc, True, Eric_Paulson, Madbomber...all the idlers in #opencall who kept nagging me to work on the stuff. 

Custom objects included were made by DOX and myself...

Hope you all enjoy the majority of the maps...  :)

Thanks for Downloading it,

INSTALLATION:

To install, simply unzip into your TRIBES directory.  

I cannot stress this enough.  Your TRIBES directory.  If you unzip into your Tribes/base folder, it will not work.  If you unzip into your tribes/base/missions folder, it will not work.  Your TRIBES folder.  If you do not follow this simple direction, dont ask me why it doesnt work.  Thanks.  

Enjoy.
