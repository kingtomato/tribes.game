7. Limited Warranty. SIERRA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EDITOR, AND MANUAL(S). THE PROGRAM, EDITOR, AND MANUAL(S) ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. SIERRA FURTHER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SPECIFICALLY, SIERRA MAKES NO WARRANTIES THAT THE PERFORMANCE OR FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PROGRAM WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY DATES PRIOR TO, DURING OR AFTER THE YEAR 2000, OR THAT THE PROGRAM WILL BE CAPABLE OF CORRECTLY PROCESSING, PROVIDING, AND/OR RECEIVING DATE INFORMATION WITHIN AND BETWEEN CENTURIES, INCLUDING THE PROPER EXCHANGE OF DATE INFORMATION BETWEEN PRODUCTS OR APPLICATIONS. ANY WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN SECTION 2-312(3) OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE AND/OR IN ANY OTHER COMPARABLE STATE STATUTE IS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. The entire risk arising out of use or performance of the Program remains with you, however Sierra warrants up to and including 90 days from the date of your purchase of the Program that the master disk on which the Program is furnished shall be free from defects in material and workmanship. In the event that the master disk proves to be defective during that time period, and upon presentation to Sierra of proof of purchase of the defective Program, Sierra will at its option 1) correct any defect, 2) provide you with a product of equal or lesser value, or 3) refund your money.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may not apply to you.
9. Equitable Remedies. You hereby agree that Sierra would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this License Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that Sierra shall be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this License Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as Sierra may otherwise have available to it under applicable laws.

You agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding by one of the parties against the other shall be commenced and maintained in any state or federal court located in the State of Washington, King County, having subject matter jurisdiction with respect to the dispute between the parties. This License Agreement may be amended, altered or modified only by an instrument in writing specifying such amendment, alteration or modification, which is executed by both parties. In the event that any provision of this License Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this License Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. 
You hereby acknowledge that you have read and understand the foregoing License Agreement and agree that the action of installing the Program is an acknowledgment of your agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of the License Agreement contained herein.
