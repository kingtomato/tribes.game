Little other than 2 Electronic Flux Cannons are stopping the enemy from decemating your way of life. A Watchtower will supply you with the location of oncoming enemies. It is protected by a heavy duty blast door and sentinel turret. In a hurry to set up defense your squadmates were able to stash the main generator in hiding but failed to hook the ELF turrets into its power grid. Two solar panels imbedded into the top of your base are all that fuel these precious items. ";
